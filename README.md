Task 1: Sum of Digits of a Number ( n = 12345	).


Task 2: Write a program that takes a sentence as input and outputs the sentence with the order of words reversed.
Example:
Input: Hello World from Students
Output: Students from World Hello


Task 3: Create a generic class called GenericList<T> that can store a collection of elements of any type. The class should allow the following operations:
Add an element to the list.
Get the element at a specific index.
Remove an element by its value.
Print all elements in the list.
Then, demonstrate its usage by creating instances of GenericList<T> with different types (e.g., int, string, Student).


Task 4: Write a C# program that uses Parallel.For to process a list of integers, performing a mathematical operation (e.g., squaring each number) in parallel. 
Ensure the program prints the result for each iteration after all tasks are completed.
